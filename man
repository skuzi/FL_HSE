Prerequisites:
dot (already installed?)
g++ (already installed?)

To run:
g++ dfa.cpp -o %binary_file%
%binary_file% %output_path%.gv
dot -Tpng %output_path.gv% %pic_name%.png

Input format:
The first line contains one integer S - the cardinality of alphabet. The second line contains one integer Q - the number of automaton's states. The third line contains q0 - the number of the initial state (1 <= q0 <= Q), Qterm - the amount of terminal states (0 <= Qterm <= Q), and Qterm numbers k_i - indexes of terminal states (1 <= k_i <= Q)
Next Q lines describe the transition function. Each line contains S numbers, j-th number in i-th line shows the index of vertix, following the (i-3)-th vertix by edge with label j.
